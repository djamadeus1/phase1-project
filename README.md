steps

- html
>> how are we marrying toy tale base code, with ramen rater to represent jewelry box
>>> what parts of toy tale base, where do we inject new code
>>> remember to pull "liker button" code..what does code to pull in 'most liked' look like...
>>> ramen has ratings...we want likes...need to figure out that change, maybe this is where toy tale code comes in..
>> "Featured Jewlery" section --> key, this is where ideally 'most liked' gets populated somehow...

- javascript
>> does ramen rater code as foundation play bigger role in javascript...

- css
>> table this until we have html + JS in better places
>> nothing in there right now...do we pull from toy tale and/or ramen 

- json
>> basic updates needed: jewelry links, names, prices, etc
>> do we need to follow similar steps from Ramen to get server 'running' ?
